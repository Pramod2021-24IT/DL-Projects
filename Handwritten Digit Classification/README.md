# Handwritten Digit Classification  

## About
- For this project, I've worked on the MNIST database.
- The MNIST data is a database of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
- The database contains 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images.

## Tasks:
Our task was to create a CNN model for identifying the digit from the handwritten images. 

## Performed the following tasks:

Performed the following steps-
* Loaded the database to variable named digit_mnist using the Keras inbuilt datasets (digit_mnist = keras.datasets.mnist)
* Imported data to create X_train_full, y_train_full, X_test and y_test variables
* Reshaped the independent (X) data
* Normalized the data
* Created a validation set of 6000 images
* Created a CNN model (Model_A) with a Conv layer of filters = 32, kernel_size = (3, 3), strides=1, padding='valid', a Max pooling layer of 2 by 2 window and two dense layers with 200 and 100 neurons
* Compiled and train the model for 60 epochs
* Ploted the loss and accuracy against epoch
* Evaluated the model accuracy on the test dataset
* Created another model (model_B) with number of filter =64
* Compared the performance and execution time for Model_A and Model_B

Model_A:

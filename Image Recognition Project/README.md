## Details About the Project:
* Binary Classification Problem (only Cat or Dog)
* Colored Images of Cats and Dogs
* No Standard Dimension (different-different dimensions of images)
* Kaggle Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
* We will use a subset of this data
  (Train:2000, Validation:1000, Test:1000)

## Process:
1. CNN with small dataset (Accuracy 71%)
2. CNN with data augmentation (Acc 80+%)
3. Transfer Learning (Acc 90+%)

## Transfer Learning: Basics
 
### Popular CNN Architectures
**Why**
1. To bulid intuition for good model architecture
2. To use these pre-trained models without retraining for our problem

**ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)**
The ILSVRC for shorts is an annual competition helped between 2010 amd 2017 in which challenge tasks use subsets of the ImegeNet dataset.

The goal of the challenge was to both
1. Promote the development of better computer vision techniques
2. To benchmark the state of the art

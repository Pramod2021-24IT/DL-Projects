## Osteoarthritis Probability

An orthopaedist is a medical doctor specializing in diagnosing and treating disorders related to the skeletal system. Part of their job is to distinguish between a healthy person and a person with Osteoarthritis by looking at their knee X-ray images.

Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis, commonly known as wear-and-tear arthritis, is a condition in which the natural cushioning between joints -- cartilage -- wears away. When this happens, the bones of the joints rub more closely against one another with less of the shock-absorbing benefits of cartilage. The rubbing results in pain, swelling, stiffness, decreased ability to move, and sometimes the formation of bone spurs.

**Task:**

We have to create a deep learning model that can detect if osteoarthritis is present or not in a given knee X-ray image using inceptionV3(GoogleNet) architecture.

## Dataset 

The Dataset contains three folders  

1. Test (845 images)
2. Train (2350 images)
3. Valid (641 images)
   
Each of these folders has two folders  

1. Test
2. Normal
